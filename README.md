## About The Project
![th3 d33p Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

th3 d33p is a small project which I'm making for fun and zero profit. It's really only to sharpen my skills in engine development, and to work on JUMG.

The game falls into the realtime-roguelike category, where the player traverses deeper into a dungeon to find loot to upgrade themselves and boost their power to be able to reach the lower levels of the dungeons.

This game is built using [JUMG](https://github.com/TheBrenny/JUMG-3.0), a side project that will help me build more games in the future, because doing that is fun!

## Playing the Game
To play the game, you'll need to have at least Java 8 installed. From there, download the jar file from the [releases page](https://github.com/TheBrenny/th3-d33p/releases)

### Modify the Code
`git clone` this repo and open it up in VSCode or Eclipse!

## Roadmap
See the [open issues](https://github.com/TheBrenny/th3-d33p/issues) for a list of known issues.
